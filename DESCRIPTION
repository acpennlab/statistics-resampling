title: A statistics package with a variety of resampling tools
description: The statistics-resampling package is an Octave
 package and Matlab toolbox that can be used to perform a wide
 variety of statistics tasks using non-parametric resampling
 methods. In particular, the functions included can be used to
 estimate bias, uncertainty (standard errors and confidence
 intervals), prediction error, information criteria, and
 calculate p-values for null hypothesis significance tests.
 Variations of the resampling methods are included that
 improve the accuracy of the statistics for small samples
 and samples with complex dependence structures.
