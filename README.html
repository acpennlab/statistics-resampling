<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The statistics-resampling package is an Octave package and Matlab
toolbox that can be used to perform a wide variety of statistics tasks
using non-parametric resampling methods. In particular, the functions
included can be used to estimate bias, uncertainty (standard errors and
confidence intervals), prediction error, and calculate <em>p</em>-values
for null hypothesis significance tests. Variations of the resampling
methods are included that improve the accuracy of the statistics for
small samples and samples with complex dependence structures.</p>

statistics-resampling package online</h3>
<p>Try out the statistics-resampling package in your browser at <a
href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/acpennlab/statistics-resampling-online/master?labpath=statistics-resampling.ipynb">statistics-resampling-online</a>
<a
href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/acpennlab/statistics-resampling-online/master?labpath=statistics-resampling.ipynb"><img
src="https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg" alt="Binder" /></a>: a
ready-to-go implementation of statistics-resampling in a JupyterLab
Notebook with an Octave kernel. <em>Note that the first time (since the
last repository commit) that you use statistics-resampling online with
Binder you can expect it to take a while to build a docker image, but
subsequent access to statistics-resampling-online will only take a few
of seconds.</em></p>
<p>Collaborative student projects in GNU Octave can use the
statistics-resampling package at <a
href="https://octave-online.net/">Octave-Online</a>. Doing so requires
users to download the latest release of the Source code (tar.gz) from <a
href="https://github.com/gnu-octave/statistics-resampling/releases">here</a>
and follow steps 2-5 of these <a
href="https://octaveonline.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/1078840-installing-custom-packages">instructions</a>.</p>
<p>Users who prefer Jupyter and have a workflow that is collaborative
and/or crosses over multiple programming languages may find it more
convenient to install and use the statistics-resampling package at <a
href="https://cocalc.com/">COCALC</a>. The approach described above (for
Octave-Online) also applies to installing the statistics-resampling
package via a Jupyter Notebook with an Octave kernel at COCALC.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you have an account with MATLAB you can try out the
statistics-resampling package at <a
href="https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=gnu-octave/statistics-resampling&amp;file=README.md">Matlab-Online</a>
<a
href="https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=gnu-octave/statistics-resampling&amp;file=README.md"><img
src="https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg"
alt="Open in MATLAB Online" /></a> by either following the local
installation instructions below, or by adding the <em>toolbox</em> (not
collection) version of the package via Apps &gt;&gt; Get More Apps.</p>
<p>Follow the links in the ‘Quick start’ section below to obtain some
examples of data and code to try out with the package.</p>
<h3 id="requirements-and-dependencies">Requirements and
dependencies</h3>
<p>Users with greater computational demands may want to consider
installing and running the statistics-resampling package offline.
Installation of the statistics-resampling package has some software
requirements. The core functions in this package require, and are known
to be compatible with, <a href="https://octave.org/">GNU Octave</a>
(version &gt;= 4.4.0) and <a
href="https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">Matlab</a> (version
&gt;= R2007a 7.4.0). Some optional features of this package have further
dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>All parallel computing options require either the <a
href="https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/parallel/">parallel
package</a> (in Octave) or the <a
href="https://uk.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html">Parallel
Computing Matlab Toolbox</a> (in Matlab). Note that the Parallel package
in Octave also requires the <a
href="https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/struct/">struct
package</a>.<br />
</li>
<li>The optional jackknife functionality in <code>boot1way</code>
requires the <a
href="https://gnu-octave.github.io/packages/statistics/">statistics
package</a> (in Octave) or the <a
href="https://uk.mathworks.com/products/statistics.html">Statistics and
Machine Learning Toolbox</a> (in Matlab).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>To install (or test) the statistics-resampling package in your
computer at a location of your choice, for either <strong>Matlab or
Octave</strong>, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the latest package release from <a
href="https://github.com/gnu-octave/statistics-resampling/releases/">here</a>.
Extract (not just browse) the contents of the compressed file (.zip or
.tar.gz), and move the package directory to the desired location.</li>
<li>Open Octave or Matlab (command prompt).</li>
<li>Change directory (cd) into the package folder. (The directory
contains a file called ‘make.m’ and ‘install.m’, among others)</li>
<li>Type <code>make</code> to compile the MEX files from source (or use
the precompiled binaries if available. If suitable precompiled binaries
are not available for your platform, then Matlab/Octave will need access
to a C++11 compiler. Note that if you skip the make step, then the
package functions will still work, but some will run slower. This step
is interactive so check the command window.)</li>
<li>Type <code>install</code>. The package will load now (and
automatically in the future) when you start Octave/Matlab.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want or need to uninstall the package, change directory (cd)
into the package folder and type uninstall.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <strong>Octave</strong> users can install the latest
release of the package just like any other Octave package by typing:</p>
<p><code>pkg install -forge statistics-resampling</code></p>
<p>Or for the most recent developmental version of the package:</p>
<p><code>pkg install "https://github.com/gnu-octave/statistics-resampling/archive/refs/heads/master.zip"</code></p>
<p>The package can then be loaded on demand in Octave with the following
commmand:</p>
<p><code>pkg load statistics-resampling</code></p>
<p>(Note that this isn’t necessary if you used the local installation
instructions first described in this section)</p>
<p>Alternatively, <strong>MATLAB</strong> users can conveniently install
the package functions as a toolbox by double-clicking the
‘statistics-resampling.mltbx’ file in the matlab subdirectory. The
toolbox installed in this way can be disabled or uninstalled via
MATLAB’s Add-On manager. MEX files are included with the toolbox
installation for Windows (32- or 64-bit), MacOS (Intel or Apple Silicon
64-bit) and Linux (64-bit).</p>

<code>pkg describe -verbose statistics-resampling</code>, or request
demonstrations of function usage by typing
<code>demo function-name</code>. Users can also request help with using
