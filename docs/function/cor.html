<h2>cor</h2>
<pre> Vectorized function for computing Pearson's correlation coefficient (RHO)
 between each of the respective columns in two data vectors or matrices.

 -- Function File: RHO = cor (X, Y)
 -- Function File: R2  = cor (X, Y, 'squared')

     'RHO = cor (X, Y)' computes Pearson's correlation coefficient (RHO)
     between the column vectors X and Y. If X and Y are matrices, then
     RHO will be a row vector corresponding to column-wise correlation
     coefficients. Hence this function is vectorised for rapid computation
     of the correlation coefficient in bootstrap resamples. Note that
     unlike the native @corr function, the correlation coefficients
     returned here are representative of the finite data sample and are
     not unbiased estimates of the population parameter.
 
     cor (X, Y) = ...

     mean ( (X - mean (X)) .* (Y - mean (Y)) ) ./ (std (X, 1) .* std (Y, 1))

     'R2 = cor (X, Y, 'squared')' as above but returns the correlation
     coefficient squared (i.e. the coefficient of determination).

    HINT: To use this function to compute Spearman's rank correlation,
    independently transform X and Y to ranks, with tied observations
    receiving the same average rank, before providing them as input to
    this function.
