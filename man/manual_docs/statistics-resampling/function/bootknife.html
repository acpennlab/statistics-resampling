     'bootknife (DATA)' uses a variant of nonparametric bootstrap, called
     bootknife [1], to generate 1999 resamples from the rows of the DATA
     (column vector or matrix) and compute their means and display the
     following statistics:
        - original: the original estimate(s) calculated by BOOTFUN and the DATA
        - bias: bootstrap bias of the estimate(s)
        - std_error: bootstrap estandard error of the estimate(s)
        - CI_lower: lower bound(s) of the 95% bootstrap confidence interval
        - CI_upper: upper bound(s) of the 95% bootstrap confidence interval

     'bootknife (DATA, NBOOT)' specifies the number of bootstrap resamples,
     where NBOOT can be either:
       <> scalar: A positive integer specifying the number of bootstrap
                  resamples [2,3] for single bootstrap, or
       <> vector: A pair of positive integers defining the number of outer and
                  inner (nested) resamples for iterated (a.k.a. double)
                  bootstrap and coverage calibration [3-6].
        The default value of NBOOT is the scalar: 1999.

     'bootknife (DATA, NBOOT, BOOTFUN)' also specifies BOOTFUN: the function
     calculated on the original sample and the bootstrap resamples. BOOTFUN
     must be either a:
       <> function handle or anonymous function,
       <> string of function name, or
       <> a cell array where the first cell is one of the above function
          definitions and the remaining cells are (additional) input arguments 
          to that function (other than the data arguments).
        In all cases BOOTFUN must take DATA for the initial input argument(s).
        BOOTFUN can return a scalar or any multidimensional numeric variable,
        but the output will be reshaped as a column vector. BOOTFUN must
        calculate a statistic representative of the finite data sample; it
        should NOT be an estimate of a population parameter (unless they are
        one of the same). If BOOTFUN is @mean or 'mean', narrowness bias of
        the confidence intervals for single bootstrap are reduced by expanding
        the probabilities of the percentiles using Student's t-distribution
        [7]. By default, BOOTFUN is @mean.

     'bootknife ({D1, D2, ...}, NBOOT, BOOTFUN)' resamples from the rows of D1,
     D2 etc and the resamples are passed to BOOTFUN as multiple data input
     arguments. All data vectors and matrices (D1, D2 etc) must have the same
     number of rows.

     'bootknife (DATA, NBOOT, BOOTFUN, ALPHA)', where ALPHA is numeric and
     sets the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval(s). The
     value(s) of ALPHA must be between 0 and 1. ALPHA can either be:
       <> scalar: To set the (nominal) central coverage of equal-tailed
                  percentile confidence intervals to 100*(1-ALPHA)%. The
                  intervals are either simple percentiles for single
                  bootstrap, or percentiles with calibrated central coverage 
                  for double bootstrap.
       <> vector: A pair of probabilities defining the (nominal) lower and
                  upper percentiles of the confidence interval(s) as
                  100*(ALPHA(1))% and 100*(ALPHA(2))% respectively. The
                  percentiles are either bias-corrected and accelerated (BCa)
                  for single bootstrap, or calibrated for double bootstrap.
        Note that the type of coverage calibration (i.e. equal-tailed or
        not) depends on whether NBOOT is a scalar or a vector. Confidence
        intervals are not calculated when the value(s) of ALPHA is/are NaN.
        The default value of ALPHA is the vector: [.025, .975], for a 95%
        confidence interval.

     'bootknife (DATA, NBOOT, BOOTFUN, ALPHA, STRATA)' also sets STRATA, which
     are identifiers that define the grouping of the DATA rows for stratified*
     bootstrap resampling. STRATA should be a column vector or cell array with
     the same number of rows as the DATA.

     'bootknife (DATA, NBOOT, BOOTFUN, ALPHA, STRATA, NPROC)' also sets the
     number of parallel processes to use to accelerate computations of double
     bootstrap, jackknife and non-vectorized function evaluations on multicore
     machines. This feature requires the Parallel package (in Octave), or the
     Parallel Computing Toolbox (in Matlab).

     'bootknife (DATA, NBOOT, BOOTFUN, ALPHA, STRATA, NPROC, BOOTSAM)' uses
     bootstrap resampling indices provided in BOOTSAM. The BOOTSAM should be a
     matrix with the same number of rows as the data. When BOOTSAM is provided,
     the first element of NBOOT is ignored.

     'STATS = bootknife (...)' returns a structure with the following fields
     (defined above): original, bias, std_error, CI_lower, CI_upper.

     '[STATS, BOOTSTAT] = bootknife (...)' returns BOOTSTAT, a vector or matrix
     of bootstrap statistics calculated over the (first, or outer layer of)
     bootstrap resamples.

     '[STATS, BOOTSTAT, BOOTSAM] = bootknife (...)' also returns BOOTSAM, the
     matrix of indices (32-bit integers) used for the (first, or outer
     layer of) bootstrap resampling. Each column in BOOTSAM corresponds
     to one bootstrap resample and contains the row indices of the values
     drawn from the nonscalar DATA argument to create that sample.

  * For cluster resampling, use the 'bootclust' function instead. Clustered
    or serially dependent data can also be analysed by the 'bootwild' and
    'bootbayes' functions.

  REQUIREMENTS:
    The function file boot.m (or better boot.mex) and bootcdf, which are
    distributed with the statistics-resampling package.

  DETAILS:
    For a DATA sample with n rows, bootknife resampling involves creating
  leave-one-out jackknife samples of size n - 1 and then drawing resamples
  of size n with replacement from the jackknife samples [1]. In contrast
  to bootstrap, bootknife resampling produces unbiased estimates of the
  standard error of BOOTFUN when n is small. The resampling of DATA rows
  is balanced in order to reduce Monte Carlo error, particularly for
  estimating the bias of BOOTFUN [8,9].
    For single bootstrap, the confidence intervals are constructed from the
  quantiles of a kernel density estimate of the bootstrap statistics
  (with shrinkage correction). 
    For double bootstrap, calibration is used to improve the accuracy of the 
  bias and standard error, and coverage of the confidence intervals [2-6]. 
  Double bootstrap confidence intervals are constructed from the empirical
  distribution of the bootstrap statistics by linear interpolation. 
    This function has no input arguments for specifying a random seed. However,
  one can reset the random number generator with a SEED value using following
  command:

     boot (1, 1, false, SEED);

    Please see the help documentation for the function 'boot' for more
  information about setting the seed for parallel execution of bootknife.
