title: A statistics package with a variety of bootstrap resampling tools
categories: package
Description: This package of functions can be used to estimate
 bias, uncertainty (standard errors and confidence intervals), 
 prediction error, and test hypotheses (p-values) using bootstrap
 resampling. Variations of the bootstrap are included that improve
 the coverage and accuracy of bootstrap confidence intervals for
 small samples and samples with complex dependence structures.
