<h2>bootcdf</h2>
<pre> Computes the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF), accounting for
 the presence of ties. Useful for bootstrap statistics, which often contain ties.

 -- Function File: [x, F] = bootcdf (y)
 -- Function File: [x, F] = bootcdf (y, trim)
 -- Function File: [x, F] = bootcdf (y, trim, m)
 -- Function File: [x, F] = bootcdf (y, trim, m, tol)
 -- Function File: [x, F, P] = bootcdf (...)

     '[x, F] = bootcdf (y)' computes the empirical cumulative distribution
     function (ECDF) of the vector y of length N. This funtction accounts for
     the presence of ties and so is suitable for computing the ECDF of
     bootstrap statistics.

     '[x, F] = bootcdf (y, trim)' removes redundant rows of the ECDF when trim
     is true. When trim is false, x and F are are the same length as y. The
     default is true.

     '[x, F] = bootcdf (y, trim, m)' specifies the denominator in the
     calculation of F as (N + m). Accepted values of m are 0 or 1, with the
     default being 0. When m is 1, quantiles formed from x and F are akin to
     qtype 6 in the R quantile function.

     '[x, F] = bootcdf (y, trim, m, tol)' applies a tolerance for the absolute
     difference in y values that constitutes a tie. The default tolerance
     is 1e-12 for double precision, or 1e-6 for single precision.

     '[x, F, P] = bootcdf (...)' also returns the distribution of P values.
