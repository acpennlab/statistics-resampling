%
%  Non-parametric bootstrap of the regression coefficients from a linear model.
%  bootcoeff accepts as input the STATS structure from fitlm or anovan functions
%  (from the v1.5+ of the Statistics package in OCTAVE) and returns a structure,
%  COEFFS, which contains the following fields:
%    original: contains the regression coefficients from the original data
%    bias: contains the bootstrap estimate of bias
%    std_error: contains the bootstrap standard error
%    CI_lower: contains the lower bound of the 95% bootstrap confidence interval
%    CI_upper: contains the upper bound of the 95% bootstrap confidence interval
%  The method uses bootknife resampling [1], which involves creating leave-one-
%  out jackknife samples of size n - 1 and then drawing samples of size n with
%  replacement from the jackknife samples. The resampling is also balanced in
%  order to reduce bias and Monte Carlo error [2,3]. By default, the confidence
%  intervals constructed are bias-corrected and accelerated intervals [4,5].
%  The list of coefficients and their bootstrap statistics correspond to the
%  names in STATS.coeffnames, which are defined by the contrast coding in
%  STATS.contrasts. The rows of STATS.contrasts correspond to the names in
%  STATS.grpnames. If no output is requested, the results are printed to stdout.
%
%  COEFFS = bootcoeff (STATS, NBOOT) also specifies the number of bootstrap 
%  samples. NBOOT can be a scalar value (for single bootstrap), or vector of
%  upto two positive integers (for double bootstrap). By default, NBOOT is
%  [2000,0]. See documentation for the bootknife function for more information.
%
%  COEFFS = bootcoeff (STATS, NBOOT, ALPHA) where ALPHA is numeric and
%  sets the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval(s). The value(s)
%  of ALPHA must be between 0 and 1. ALPHA can either be a scalar value to set
%  the (nominal) central coverage, or a vector of 2 numeric values corresponding
%  to a pair of probabilities to set the (nominal) lower and upper percentiles.
%  The value(s) of ALPHA must be between 0 and 1. The method for constructing
%  confidence intervals is determined by the combined settings of ALPHA and
%  NBOOT. See documentation for the bootknife function for more information. 
%  Confidence intervals are not calculated when the value(s) of ALPHA is/are NaN. 
%
%  COEFFS = bootcoeff (STATS, NBOOT, ALPHA, NPROC) also sets the number of
%  parallel processes to use to accelerate computations on multicore machines.
%  This feature requires the Parallel package (in Octave). See documentation
%  for the bootknife function for more information.
%
%  COEFFS = bootcoeff (STATS, NBOOT, ALPHA, NPROC, SEED) also sets the random
%  SEED for the random number generator used for the resampling. This feature
%  can be used to make the results of the bootstrap reproducible.
%
%  Requirements: The function file boot.m (or better boot.mex) and bootknife
%  also distributed in the statistics-bootstrap package. bootcoeff is only
%  supported in GNU Octave and requires the Statistics package version 1.5+.
