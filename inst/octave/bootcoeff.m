%
%  Semi-parametric bootstrap of the regression coefficients from a linear model.
%  bootcoeff accepts as input the STATS structure from fitlm or anovan functions
%  (from the v1.5+ of the Statistics package in OCTAVE) and returns a structure,
%  COEFFS, which contains the following fields:
%    original: contains the regression coefficients from the original data
%    bias: contains the bootstrap estimate of bias
%    std_error: contains the bootstrap standard error
%    CI_lower: contains the lower bound of the 95% bootstrap confidence interval
%    CI_upper: contains the upper bound of the 95% bootstrap confidence interval
%  The method uses bootknife resampling [1], which involves creating leave-one-
%  out jackknife samples of size n - 1 from the n residuals and then drawing
%  samples of size n with replacement from the jackknife samples. The resampling
%  of residuals is also balanced in order to reduce bias and Monte Carlo error
%  [2,3]. By default, the confidence intervals constructed are bias-corrected
%  percentile intervals [4,5]. The list of coefficients and their bootstrap
%  statistics correspond to the names in STATS.coeffnames, which are defined by
%  the contrast coding in STATS.contrasts. The rows of STATS.contrasts 
%  correspond to the names in STATS.grpnames. If no output is requested, the
%  results are printed to stdout.
%  
%  COEFFS = bootcoeff (STATS, NBOOT) also specifies the number of bootstrap
%  samples. NBOOT must be a scalar. By default, NBOOT is 2000.
%
%  COEFFS = bootcoeff (STATS, NBOOT, ALPHA) where ALPHA is numeric and
%  sets the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval(s). The value(s)
%  of ALPHA must be between 0 and 1. ALPHA can either be:
%
%  1) a scalar value to set the (nominal) central coverage to 100*(1-ALPHA)%
%  with (nominal) lower and upper percentiles of the confidence intervals at
%  100*(ALPHA/2)% and 100*(1-ALPHA/2)% respectively. The intervals constructed
%  bias-corrected [4].
%
%  2) a vector containing a pair of probabilities to set the (nominal) lower and
%  upper percentiles of the confidence interval(s) at 100*(ALPHA(1))% and
%  100*(ALPHA(2))%. The intervals constructed are simple percentile intervals.
%
%  Confidence interval endpoints are not calculated when the value(s) of ALPHA
%  is/are NaN. If empty (or not specified), the default value for ALPHA is 0.05
%
%  COEFFS = bootcoeff (STATS, NBOOT, ALPHA, NPROC) also sets the number of
%  parallel processes to use to accelerate computations on multicore machines.
%  This feature requires the Parallel package (in Octave).
%
%  COEFFS = bootcoeff (STATS, NBOOT, ALPHA, NPROC, SEED) also sets the random
%  SEED for the random number generator used for the resampling. This feature
%  can be used to make the results of the bootstrap reproducible.
%
%  Requirements: The function file boot.m (or better boot.mex) and bootknife
%  also distributed in the statistics-bootstrap package. bootcoeff is only
%  supported in GNU Octave and requires the Statistics package version 1.5+.
