<h2>smoothmedian</h2>
<pre> Calculates a smoothed version of the median.

 -- Function File: M = smoothmedian (X)
 -- Function File: M = smoothmedian (X, DIM)
 -- Function File: M = smoothmedian (X, DIM, TOL)

     If X is a vector, find the univariate smoothed median (M) of X. If X is a
     matrix, compute the univariate smoothed median value for each column and
     return them in a row vector.  If the optional argument DIM is given,
     operate along this dimension. Arrays of more than two dimensions are not
     NaN values currently supported. The MEX file versions of this function
     ignore (omit) whereas the m-file includes NaN in it's calculations. Use
     the 'which' command to establish which version of the function is being
     used.

     The smoothed median is a slightly smoothed version of the ordinary median
     and is an M-estimator that is both robust and efficient:

     | Asymptotic                            | Mean |    Median  |    Median  |
     | properties                            |      | (smoothed) | (ordinary) |
     |---------------------------------------|------|------------|------------|
     | Breakdown point                       | 0.00 |      0.341 |      0.500 |
     | Pitman efficacy                       | 1.00 |      0.865 |      0.637 |

     Smoothing the median is achieved by minimizing the objective function:

           S (M) = sum (((X(i) - M).^2 + (X(j) - M).^2).^ 0.5)
                  i < j
 
     where i and j refers to the indices of the Cartesian product of each
     column of X with itself. 

     With the ordinary median as the initial value of M, this function
     minimizes the above objective function by finding the root of the first
     derivative using a fast, but reliable, Newton-Bisection hybrid algorithm.
     The tolerance (TOL) is the maximum value of the step size that is
     acceptable to break from optimization. By default, TOL = range * 1e-04.

     The smoothing works by slightly reducing the breakdown point of the median.
     Bootstrap confidence intervals using the smoothed median have good
     coverage for the ordinary median of the population distribution and can be
     used to obtain second order accurate intervals with Studentized bootstrap
     and calibrated percentile bootstrap methods [1]. When the population
     distribution is thought to be strongly skewed, coverage errors can be
     reduced by improving symmetry through appropriate data transformation.
     Unlike kernel-based smoothing approaches, bootstrapping smoothmedian does
     not require explicit choice of a smoothing parameter or a probability
     density function.
