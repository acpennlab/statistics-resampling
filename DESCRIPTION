title: A statistics package with a variety of resampling tools
categories: package
Description: The statistics-resampling package is an Octave 
 package and Matlab toolbox that can be used to overcome a wide
 variety of statistics problems using non-parametric resampling 
 methods. In particular, the functions included can be used to 
 estimate bias, uncertainty (standard errors and confidence
 intervals), prediction error, and test hypotheses (p-values) 
 using resampling methods. Variations of the resampling methods 
 are included that improve the accuracy of the statistics for
 small samples and samples with complex dependence structures.
